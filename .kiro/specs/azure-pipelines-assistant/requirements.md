# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Azure Pipeline Runner is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides the ability to trigger, monitor, and manage Azure DevOps pipelines directly within the editor. This extension focuses on running pipelines and providing real-time feedback on execution status, similar to existing pipeline runner tools but integrated into the VS Code environment. The extension will be compatible with VS Code, Cursor IDE, and Windsurf IDE, and distributed through the Open VSX Registry.

4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with setup instructions in the Activity Bar view
5. WHEN a PAT expires THEN the system SHALL automatically detect expiration and notify the user
6. WHEN storing authentication data THEN the system SHALL use VS Code's secure storage for the PAT
7. WHEN configuration is successful THEN the system SHALL immediately refresh the Activity Bar view to show pipeline data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to perform efficiently with large amounts of pipeline data, so that it doesn't slow down my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading pipeline data THEN the system SHALL implement in-memory caching with a 5-minute cache duration
2. WHEN refreshing data THEN the system SHALL only fetch changed data using API timestamps for incremental updates
3. WHEN displaying detailed information THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading to load details only when requested
